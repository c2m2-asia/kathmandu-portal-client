      Ramesh Dhakal, the owner of Hotel Green Horizon and Nepal Mountain
      Trekkers, started as a porter. He entered tourism in 1997, following his
      friends from Dhading to Kathmandu. However, it was the Visit Nepal 1999
      that prompted him to be a regular worker in tourism.

      Right before the pandemic, he had renovated his hotel, adding a
      seventy-seat restaurant as a preparation for the Visit Nepal 2020. Now,
      the investment seems like a lost cause. He has had zero income for more
      than a year now. Little savings that he had helped bear the costs for a
      few months. He had to borrow some from his friends as he could not
      approach any banks or financial institutions due to the lack of
      collateral. He says that he has no asset or property, everything he had
      has been invested in the hotel. When asked how the fall in income has hit
      his business- he pauses and reflects. Perhaps the stories of struggles are
      complex and layered- than what he wants to or can share in a short
      interview. He was compelled to lay off 14 of his staff, reducing his
      workforce from 18 to 4. He now has only one regular staff in trekking,
      there were 5 earlier. A few guides he knew have left their jobs and have
      switched to agriculture.

      While business has taken a hit and he has had to lay off workers, he has
      received little to no support from the government.{' '}

      Ramesh also highlights the latent impacts of COVID. He notes that the
      escalation in financial troubles and the lockdown due to the pandemic has
      affected people’s mental health even more than their finances. No one
      knows what hidden implications these might have. His energy to work more,
      take tourism to new heights has faded. He used to donate 5% of his income
      to charity now he doesn’t even feel like working anymore. Rather, he finds
      it difficult to open up and share.

      He represents not just himself but hundreds of other entrepreneurs in
      Thamel, who have spent decades of their life in the industry. For the
      longest of times, tourism was their source of bread and butter. The
      COVID-induced lockdown and travel restrictions have severely impacted
      their major source of livelihood.{' '}

        “I have spent my years in this sector, and I can’t start from zero
        again,”

      he sighs towards the end of the conversation.
