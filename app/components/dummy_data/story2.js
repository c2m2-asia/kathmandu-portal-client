      Saila dai’s shop looked just like any other tourist bag shop we see at
      Thamel with varieties of jute and hemp bags of all sizes ornamented all
      around. As we entered the store, Saila dai was seated at the counter, he
      showed us around seemingly self-conscious about the goods, repeatedly
      adding, “<i>aba arko pali ramro saman lyaunu parcha</i>” (which translates
      to “we need to bring better goods next time”). He was a lean guy in his
      early 40s, with veiny arms and sleeves, dragged up to his elbow; he
      offered us tea: the traditional Nepali culture of treating guests was not
      forgotten even in such times of crises.

      <i>Bhauju</i>, his wife, sat nearby throughout the interview. Before the
      lockdown, she used to manage another shop, even bigger than this one.
      After the first lockdown, the bills got difficult to manage and the
      landlord was constantly troubling them for rent compelling them to shut
      that shop. They packed the leftovers and brought them to this current
      store. This shop is owned by someone else, but they agreed to let Saila
      dai sell his goods too. It had been around 20 years he was working here,
      the owners were more like his family now.

      Saila dai was 12/13 years old when he first came to Kathmandu in 1991. He
      sold souvenirs to tourists back then. Adding up the years, we collectively
      figure it has been around 30 years since he has been working in the
      tourism industry. In those 30 years, he says, the lockdown has been like
      no other, the troubles of the earthquake did not even count to a percent
      of what COVID-19 has done to their lives.

      During the lockdown, there was a phase where he thought they would die of
      hunger. There was no income and the savings were dwindling rapidly.
      Seemingly out of sources of income, they thought of selling vegetables as
      a desperate attempt to make their ends meet. However, even that did not
      seem like a good idea.
      <i>
        “Back in those lockdown days, sales in the footpath were not allowed, a
        thela (vegetable cart) was compulsory, but the investment for thela
        could instead be used to cover the daily necessities for at least a few
        days”
      </i>
      . Struggling with procuring even basic everyday meals, the choice was
      clear. During those desperate times, he heard of government relief
      packages and enlisted his name. Receiving food support from the
      government, although took months to arrive, seemed like appreciable
      support.

      After the lockdown was lifted, he opened the shop but the place was
      deserted. He asks, “For whom do we even unload the items?”

      As he was speaking, a few teenage girls entered the shop and bought a few
      purses, bargaining from 400 to 200. Bhauju was unsure of giving away the
      purses at this price but for Saila dai the priority, at this moment, was
      sustaining the business rather than earning a profit.

      Saila dai says he is terrified, he looks uncertain of his future and
      stutters expressing his anger with whatever has happened after the
      pandemic. Profit at this point is unimaginable selling one bag a week and
      at this rate. The revenue is hardly enough to cover electricity and rent-
      let alone his own cost of living. The owners are thinking of closing the
      shop if this goes on for too long. Closure of this shop would mean the
      closure of his sole source of income. Saila dai ponders on what to do
      next. The answer is as uncertain as the situation brought forth by
      COVID-19.
